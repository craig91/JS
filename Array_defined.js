// Javascript provides a data type specifically for storing sequences of values. 
// It is called an array and is written as a list of values between square [] 
// brackets, seperated by commas. 

// The notation for getting at the elements inside an array also uses square brackets. 
// A pair of square brackets immidiately after an expression, with another expression 
// inside of them, will look up the element in the left-hand expression that corresponds
// to the index given by the expression in the brackets

  console.log(listOfNumbers[0])
