// Write the code that reads the second value out of an array names myArray:

var myFavoriteNumber = 77
var yourFavoriteNumber = 66
if (myFavoriteNumber > yourFavoriteNumber) {
	console.log("A")
} else {
	console.log("B")
}
console.log("C")


/* When trying to figure this problem out, you must read the question carefully. Even though there
is no array shown, you can see that because of the 2 variables, you can make an array for both of
the 2 values of the variables, so: */
 
 var myArray = [66,77] 

 // The if statement is asking weather myFavoriteNumber (77) is larger than yourFavoriteNumber (66)

 if (myFavoriteNumber > yourFavoriteNumber){

 }

 /* 77 is greater than 66 so this is true.}else{ } is asking if myFavoriteNumber
 > yourFavoriteNumber returns false, then ("B") will be printed to the console. 
 Since this is not the case, ("A") will be printed to the console. Since this
 is true, ("C") will always print to the console.
